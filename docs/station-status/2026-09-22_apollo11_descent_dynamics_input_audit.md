# Station research status — Apollo 11 descent dynamics input audit

Date: 2026-09-22

## GUIDANCE / FIDO

**Status: PARTIALLY DOCUMENTED, bounded.** TRW Note 70-FMT-819 Volume I documents mission-specific postflight continuous LM trajectory reconstruction from DOI through touchdown. NASA TN D-6846 supplies a primary validation envelope. The 45-day BET NAT listing remains **BLOCKED ON NAMED SOURCE RECOVERY — Volume II**.

## CONTROL

**Status: PARTIALLY DOCUMENTED; exact DPS handbook target identified.** Apollo 11 Mission Report §9.8/fig. 9.8-1 document powered-descent timing and flight throttle/pressure histories. Appendix A.6/table A-I documents named event masses but no PDI mass.

The Apollo 11 Press Kit specifies **9,870 lbf** maximum-rated DPS thrust; NASA TN D-7143 records a **10,500-lbf maximum-rated design requirement**. The Mission Report confirms LM-5 throttle-up to FTP about 26 seconds after PDI. LMA790-3-LM page 2.2-215, **Change Date 15 June 1969**, directly documents the **92.5% THRUST** TTCA hard stop in the LM-5 handbook state.

The next CONTROL source is now identified exactly: **LMA790-3-LM §2.3.5, page 2.3-25, Table 2.3-1 — Descent Propulsion Section Performance and Design Data**. The September 1969 LM-6 Volume-I contents/illustration material places the performance section/table there. However, the searchable copy does not expose a reliable page-2.3-25 effective date or legible table values. Consequently the table is **LOCATED BUT NOT YET CONFIGURATION-QUALIFIED** for LM-5.

A later NASA-hosted handbook preserves the same section/table/page structure but is only a locator cross-check. Its values must not be back-projected onto Eagle.

## FLIGHT / CAPCOM

**Status: unchanged.** No new GO/NO-GO criterion or crew-facing call follows from this source recovery.

## Implementation boundary

Keep PDI mass modelled until explicitly recovered. Preserve 9,870 lbf as Apollo 11 preflight specification, FTP as an Apollo 11 flight control state, and 92.5 percent as an LM-5-effective documented control hard stop. Do **not** numerically equate 92.5 percent with 9,870 lbf without LM-5-specific force-calibration evidence.
